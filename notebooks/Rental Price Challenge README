# 🏠 rental_price_challenge

This is my **first Machine Learning project with a user interface (UI)**.  
It predicts rental prices for houses based on simple input features like size, number of rooms, and location. The UI was built using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to make it easy for anyone to test the model.

## 🚀 Purpose

To complete a full ML pipeline — from data analysis and model training to a functional interface — with a beginner-friendly approach.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The app uses a **Linear Regression model** trained on a simplified dataset to predict rental prices.

### ✨ User Inputs:
- Size of the house (in m²)
- Number of bedrooms
- Age of the house
- Garage (yes or no)
- Location: Downtown, Suburb, or Outskirts

### 📤 Output:
- Estimated rental price (R$)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `rental_price_challenge.ipynb`: Main notebook with data prep, model training, and the Gradio UI.
- `.pkl` model file is **not included**, since it is generated automatically when running the notebook.
- `dataset_aluguel.csv`: The dataset used for training.
- The app interface is included and launches directly from the notebook.
